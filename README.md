# template

**A sane starting point for small KnickKnackLabs tools.**

Copy the boring parts so the interesting parts start sooner.

## What this is

`template` is the default empty room for a new KnickKnackLabs tool: mise-managed tasks, parallel BATS tests, codebase convention lints, generated README, CI, and a `doctor` task that tells you whether your clone has the optional local pre-commit hook installed.

This is deliberately a normal repo, not a GitHub template repo. Copy the files, start fresh history for the new tool, and keep this repo as the living reference skeleton.

It intentionally does **not** decide what your product does. Copy it, rename the obvious constants, then add the first real command only when the workflow is clear.

## Quick start

```bash
gh repo clone KnickKnackLabs/template my-tool
cd my-tool

# Start the new tool with its own history instead of inheriting template commits.
rm -rf .git
git init -b main

mise trust
mise install
mise run test
mise run doctor

# Optional local safety net: installs .git/hooks/pre-commit.d/codebase
codebase pre-commit

# When the skeleton is shaped for the new tool, create and push its repo.
git add .
git commit -m "chore: start from KKL tool skeleton"
gh repo create KnickKnackLabs/my-tool --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Goodies baked in

| Goodie               | Why it exists                                                                                            | Where                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Generated README     | TSX can count tests, list tasks, and keep docs honest in CI.                                             | `README.tsx`                 |
| Doctor hook check    | Local pre-commit hooks are clone-local, so the repo can report them without pretending they are tracked. | `mise run doctor`            |
| Convention lints     | Best-practice drift gets caught as code, not folklore.                                                   | `[_.codebase].lint`          |
| Real test path       | BATS tests call tasks through `mise run`, not raw scripts.                                               | `test/test_helper.bash`      |
| Public test workflow | The complete BATS runner stays visible and testable at the public task boundary.                         | `.mise/tasks/test`           |
| Parallel BATS        | The KKL Bats fork and Rush schedule isolated tests concurrently across and within files.                 | `.mise/tasks/test`           |
| Mac + Linux CI       | Bash and tooling differences show up before merge.                                                       | ubuntu-latest + macos-latest |

| `lib/`                       | ✓      | shared sourced code starts here when needed |

## Tasks

| Task              | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `mise run doctor` | Check local development setup |
| `mise run test`   | Run BATS tests                |

## Parallel tests

The canonical test task uses the [KKL-maintained Bats fork](https://github.com/KnickKnackLabs/bats-core) with [Rush](https://github.com/shenwei356/rush) and a measured four-job default. Isolated tests can run concurrently across separate files and within one file.

```bash
mise run test                         # measured four-job default
mise run test --jobs 4                # explicit job count
BATS_NUMBER_OF_PARALLEL_JOBS=2 mise run test
mise run test --jobs 1                # serial debugging
```

Parallel suites must isolate mutable state per test and process. Use `$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR`, unique ports, and fixture-local repositories instead of shared files, services, HOME overrides, or repository mutations.

## When you copy it

1. Rename `PROJECT` in `README.tsx`.
2. Rewrite this README around the actual tool, but keep the dynamic counters if they help.
3. Replace `CONTRIBUTING.md` with repo-specific orientation.
4. Keep the complete test runner in `.mise/tasks/test` so the public task is the tested workflow.
5. Keep other public `.mise/tasks` readable and command-shaped; extract sourced Bash under `lib/` only when multiple commands share one domain contract.
6. If the installed tool resolves caller-relative paths, read the shiv-provided `<PACKAGE>_CALLER_PWD` variable, not generic `CALLER_PWD`.
7. Keep parallel tests isolated per test/process, or opt the suite into serial execution until shared state is removed.

<details>
<summary><b>Current convention checks</b></summary>

This template currently asks [codebase](https://github.com/KnickKnackLabs/codebase) to run these lint rules:

```
@all
```

</details>

## Validation

```bash
mise run test
codebase lint "$PWD"
readme build --check
git diff --check
```

The starter suite currently has **12 tests** and **2 public tasks**. Those numbers are read from the repo at README build time.
